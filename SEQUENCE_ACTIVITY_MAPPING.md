# SEQUENCE â†” ACTIVITY DIAGRAMS MAPPING

## Relationship Between Diagrams

Each business function has both a **Sequence Diagram** (showing actor interactions) and an **Activity Diagram** (showing process flow).

### 1. User Authentication

| Diagram Type | File | Purpose |
|--------------|------|----------|
| **Sequence** | `main_sequence_user_authentication.txt` | Shows **who** does **what** and **when** |
| **Activity** | `activity_user_authentication_activity.txt` | Shows **how** the process flows with **decisions** |

**When to use:**
- **Sequence Diagram**: For understanding system architecture, API calls, actor responsibilities
- **Activity Diagram**: For understanding business logic, decision points, alternative flows

## Quick Reference

### Sequence Diagrams
- **Focus**: Actor interactions and method calls
- **Format**: Vertical timeline showing message passing
- **Best for**: Technical documentation, API design

### Activity Diagrams
- **Focus**: Process flow and business logic
- **Format**: Flowchart with decision points
- **Best for**: Business process documentation, user training
